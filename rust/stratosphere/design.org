Tactics game to start with
Top-down. No map rotation needed.
Turn based.
Several squads.
Arbitrary win conditions. Just a boolean function set on each squad. Examples are destroy all enemies (map.units.filter(team != this.team) == empty) Hold capture points, etc.
Grid based (each grid = 1 inch if tabletop)

Mechs?

Each mech has 6 parts.
Head
Arms (L,R)
Body
Legs (L,R)

Head contains sensors, disabled head makes hitting harder (+2 difficulty)
Body is overall health, a disabled body is a disabled mech
Arms contain weapons, disabled arm disables those weapons
Legs are movement. One destroyed leg is halved (rounded down) movement, two is reduced to 1 square movement.
