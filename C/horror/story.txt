The rain came lightly at first, nothing to worry about, flick on the wipers. It's not like this part of the drive is exactly mentally stimulating, after all; the rust belt isn't know for its variety in the first place, and it's been miles upon miles of open, flat road for the last 12 hours. I've been telling myself that I'll stop at the next town, but a real town never comes, just the abandoned husks of towns without a soul living there, and the inevitable decrepit, half-collapsed mill, what's left standing covered in graffiti. The rain worsens; flick the wipers up to full. Wind starts to buffet the car, moaning as it slips around my antenna, near-imperceptibly raising the left side of the car over the right. These are special, nothing to stop them from Colorado all the way to here, a thousand miles to pick up strength and it feels like it.
