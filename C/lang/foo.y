// define the "terminal symbol" token types I'm going to use, which
// are in CAPS by convention:
%token INT FLOAT STRING

// yacc asks lex for the next token, which is returned as being of type "yystype".  But
// the next token could be of an arbitrary data type, so you can define a C union to
// hold each of the types of tokens that lex could return, and yacc will typedef
// "yystype" as the union instead of its default (int):
%union {
	int ival;
	float fval;
	char *sval;
}

// and then you just associate each of the defined token types with one of
// the union fields and we're happy:
%token <ival> INT
%token <fval> FLOAT
%token <sval> STRING

// this is the actual grammar that yacc will parse, but for right now it's just
// something silly to echo to the screen what yacc gets from lex.  We'll
// make a real one shortly:
snazzle:
	snazzle INT { cout << "yacc found an int: " << $2 << endl; }
	| snazzle FLOAT { cout << "yacc found a float: " << $2 << endl; }
	| snazzle STRING { cout << "yacc found a string: " << $2 << endl; } 
	| INT { cout << "yacc found an int: " << $1 << endl; }
	| FLOAT { cout << "yacc found a float: " << $1 << endl; }
	| STRING { cout << "yacc found a string: " << $1 << endl; }

extern int yyparse();
extern FILE *yyin;

main() {

	FILE *myfile = fopen("a.snazzle.file", "r");
	// make sure it is valid:
	if (!myfile) {

		return -1;

	// set lex to read from it instead of defaulting to STDIN:
	yyin = myfile;
