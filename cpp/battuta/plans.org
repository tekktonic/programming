* Basics
** One player, shared between all rooms (static field)
** Interactables
just call to lua code, which is embedded in their json. Lua code
should have  "this" and a table of other interactables
defined in its context. Lua code has access to basic
functionality inside. moveto, take, use.
** Serialization
Everything can serialize to json or a json value, period. Entire
game state can be dumped at any time for saves. This allows more
permanence at the cost of bigger save files, but disk is cheap and
json compresses well.
