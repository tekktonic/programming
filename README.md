This repository contains (most) of the code that I've written over the past few years.
A fair amount has been lost due to disk failures, but this is what I happen to have left.
It's mainly game prototypes in various languages, although there are a few tools and protocol things.
There are also plenty of syntax checks and aborted starts where I just started sketching out what
something *may* look like but didn't want to actually implement it for lack of libraries or some other reason.

I did a quick sweep for copyright issues, since I usually just use whatever I have in my home directory as
a placeholder but I may have missed things, if I did you can contact me one tekk <AT> parlementum net. Unless otherwise indicated, all of the projects are under the ISC license as used by OpenBSD, which can be seen in the COPYING file.
