Skald (Simple KeepALive Daemons) is a collection of monitoring daemons with one job: tell you when a service is down. They do this by sending a heartbeat message to the place given, and if the heartbeat succeeds by however it defines success, it waits. If the heartbeat fails, an e-mail is sent to the given address. This can be used to send text alerts by making use of the carrier e-mail to sms bridges, which every carrier I'm aware of maintains.
